# mcast

## Description
This is a command line utility and library written to test out multicast
traffic flows on the network, and stress test the network and devices.

This utility is capable of entirely disrupting an L2 environment that isn't
robustly configured, so caution is urged.

mcast is a command line utility capable of sending and recieving multicast
or generic UDP traffic. It also allows simulation of IGMP joins, leaves, and
querying.
